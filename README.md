# etch_a_sketch
TOP Etch-A-Sketch project  

Plans:  
- use flexbox  
- use grid once I'm comfortable with creating grid system w/ flexbox  
- DOM manipulation...a lot  
- make it more organized this time  
- less green  

Learned:  
- a bit more about positioning with flexbox  
- creating grid elements dynamically  
- more about click events - mouseover events more precisely  
- using color picker  
- shading

Updates:  
- Realized I had a few issues with the coloring functions. Turning on shading shaded but those cells which did not have a color, it set the color of the color-picker value if it was used. If not, it set the default value. Had to use some if-else logic but now it works. 

Takeaway(s):  

I'm yet to try creating this with CSS Grid. I'll probably use template literals with variables like I did it here, only it's not going to be flexbox.  

It took a lot more to determine shading than I'd liked and the dynamic grid-element creation was also quite a task, I had to google for it.  

Managed to find bugs before creating a function and sometimes during: that's a great step, considering I'd been finding bugs dominantly after I was done.
